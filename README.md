<h1 style = 'color:#f2d53c'> Project 3: Sharing Dataset on Kaggle </h1>
<a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/fahadalqahtani/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege' > tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege on kaggle </a>

<p> For this project I have selected a game Leaderboard website  that contains the stats  of over than  17 million player  (wins, time playedâ€¦.). the idea of selecting  this website is to see what is  the  important skills that top players  have in common . I am going to do Web-scrapeing on <a href ='https://r6.tracker.network/leaderboards/pvp-season/all/Mmr?region=-1&season=17'> R6Tracker website  </a>
</p>


<h1 style = 'color:#f2d53c' >Web Scraping </h1>
So first thing I am going to take 849 leaderboard page 

<a href = 'https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege'>

</a>

#### getting leaderboards pages 
```python
from time import sleep
driver = webdriver.Chrome('chromedriver.exe')
driver.get('https://r6.tracker.network/leaderboards/pvp-season/psn/Mmr?region=-1&season=17')
for i in range(849):
    # create browser obj
    lst_.append(driver.page_source)
    # access search box 
    next_ = driver.find_element_by_link_text("Next")
    sleep(2)
    next_.click()
    sleep(2)
```

#### getting players stat
<a href = 'https://r6.tracker.network/profile/psn/JstDiogo'> 
<img src = 'stats.jpg'/>
</a>


```python

stats_pages  = []
try:
    for nm in all_names :
        for elm in [requests.get(f'https://r6.tracker.network/profile/psn/{nm}')]:
            stats_pages.append(elm.text)
except Exception as e :
    pass 
```
